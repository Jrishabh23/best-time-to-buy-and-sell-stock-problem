// Algorithm

Step 1: Get pries of array and count length.
Step 1.2: If length is equal to zero then return;
Step 1.3: If length is equal to one then return that value
Step 2: Iterate the pries array and create 3 variable buy_day, sell_day, and profit and assign value to zero
Step 2.1 : In the iteration scope ,iterate loop again start index of first iteration loop and create variable profitCount and assign zero
Step 2.2: In the second iteration start, first iteration index+1
Step 3: In second iteration count profit
Step 3.1: If profitCount is greater than profit value then copy data in buy_day, sell_day, and profit
Step 3.2: If profitCount is less than profit value then no copy data
Step 4: If count the profit
Step 4.1: If profit is zero then no transaction
Step 4.2: If profit is greater than zero then return information
Step 5: End
